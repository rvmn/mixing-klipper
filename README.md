# mixing-klipper
mixing config (for a Zonestar Z9V5 or others) 

Klipper macros and config working functionally on a Zonestar Z9V5 but should be easily interchangeable.
Set up for a 4-in-1 out mixing extruder (M4V6 extruder, can be bought seperately for a decent price on ALi/others)

@Nathan22211 for making the source version, with 3-in-1 out extruder
